This system is a comprehensive Large Language Model (LLM) based framework, tailored for the classification and management of Neuroscience and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) related research paper abstracts. Using advanced AI models and their tunable hyper-parameters, the framework classifies a research paper into predefined categories such as Publication Type, Data Type, Population, Recording Type, etc.. It also provides interfaces to evaluate the classification accuracy, assign the unclassified abstracts to registered users and maintain the classified abstracts in a central database.
